            <h2>SHRIMP</h2>
            <p>
                No doubt about it, shrimp is one of our favorite ingredients to cook with. They cook SO fast, are super convenient (you can swap in frozen for pretty much any of these recipes!), and fit into so many recipes, from fancy side dishes and special occasion romantic meals, to party appetizers and casual weeknight dinners.
                 We have rounded up 42 shrimp recipes to inspire you—we bet you all fall in love with the little pink crustacean as much as we have.
                One of the greatest things about shrimp is how easily it can be swapped for other proteins
                 (particularly if you are low on time and want a quick shortcut). Looking for a quick appetizer or side dish? Try our bang bang shrimp, our shrimp cocktail (classic!), our shrimp tostada bites, or our shrimp toasts. Love chicken and rice? Swap shrimp in instead, like in our simply named shrimp and rice,
                 our sweet corn shrimp & rice skillet, or our one-pan salsa verde
                 shrimp and rice.
