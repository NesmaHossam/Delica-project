            <h2>SALAMON FISH</h2>
            <p>
                In a dinnertime rut? Nix your regular ol' chicken or beef standbys with tender, flavorful salmon. If you're new to cooking salmon, there's no need to stress. It's hard to mess up, and baking up a whole salmon fillet looks so impressive yet easily feeds a crowd. If you're a salmon newbie, you'll love how easy it is to bake up our maple bacon salmon and pineapple salmon, and you can even let your slow-cooker do the heavy lifting with our slow-cooker salmon with lemon and dill. Because why shouldn't getting your daily recommended amount of omega-3s be as easy and delicious as possible?

                No matter if you bake, pan-fry, poach, or grill your salmon, it's almost impossible to get into a rut when you can choose between coconut curry salmon, Asian BBQ salmon, and Greek salmon. Most of these recipes come together super fast too. So if you're in a time crunch, you're never too far from having honey glazed salmon, Tuscan butter salmon or blackened salmon tacos on the table.

                Looking for new ways to incorporate salmon? Try mixing it up with our Greek-inspired salmon burgers, salmon ceviche, and smoked salmon pasta. Speaking of smoked and cured salmon, lox is one of our favorite ways to start our day. Make a bagel and lox for your next breakfast and you'll see why it's a New York staple.
