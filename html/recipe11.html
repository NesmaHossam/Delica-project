            <h2>CHICKEN(SWEET&SOUR)</h2>
            <p>·Sweet and Sour Chicken is a classic Chinese takeout option most of us are too afraid to make at home. Something 
            about woks and cooking with pineapple make it intimidating for most, but it is so much easier to make than you would think.
            Of the classic Chinese Recipes that most people ask for on my blog the one I hear about
            the absolute most is sweet and sour chicken. I totally get it, it isnt even just the recipe, but THAT SAUCE. When I was a teenager and I made this sauce for
            the first time I also actually started learning how to use chopsticks. So for a solid month (I kid you not, my mom was not thrilled with this), I used chopsticks
            for every meal and had a tiny little bowl of Sweet and Sour Chicken Sauce to dip everything into it..</p><br>
